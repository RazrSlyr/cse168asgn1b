# CSE 168 Assignment 1B
## What is the Assignment?
The goal of the assignment was to convert our CSE 160 final projects into a VR experience, along with adding additional functionality descriped in the writeup.
## How did we do it?
Utilizing this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQhhK2sH77w&ab_channel=NikLever) mentioned by the professor on the class website, were able to convert our programs to VR experiences. Since our final projects are all pretty different from each other, we decided it would be best to have them be separated, with the submission containing a file that links them together. Following that, we incorporated the VR specific features by following and modifying the [WebXR examples](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=webxr) on the threejs website.
